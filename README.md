I am having some difficulties on using Visual Studio 2022 and GitHub.
I tried using Copilot to help me fix it but the only thing I was able to do is to push files manually using VS Powershell terminal.
It also seems GitHub site didn't recognized the C++ codes.
This repository is related to Pointers Arithmetics and Pointers to Pointers.

If you know what I doing wrong please send me an e-mail: karkekoisaaeh@outlook.com
